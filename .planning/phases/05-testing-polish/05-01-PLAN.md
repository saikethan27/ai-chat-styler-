# Plan 05-01: Comprehensive Test Page

## Objective

Create a comprehensive test.html page with all markdown elements styled with Claude aesthetic for local testing and verification.

**What this builds:** A single-page test harness that exercises all CSS rules, visual indicators, and theme variations without needing to visit external sites.

**Why it matters:** Enables rapid iteration on styling and provides a reference for what "correct" looks like across all markdown element types.

## Requirements

- TEST-01: Local test page with all markdown elements

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Comprehensive test.html

**Goal:** Build a test page covering all markdown elements that the extension styles.

**Implementation:**
1. Create test.html in project root
2. Include sections for:
   - Headers (H1-H6)
   - Paragraphs and text formatting
   - Lists (ordered, unordered, nested)
   - Code blocks (inline and fenced)
   - Blockquotes
   - Tables
   - Horizontal rules
   - Links
   - Images
   - Task lists
   - Definition lists (if supported)
3. Add toggle buttons for:
   - Light/Dark mode
   - Enable/Disable styling
4. Include visual indicator toggles
5. Add performance metrics display

**Files to modify/create:**
- Create: test.html

**Commit:** feat(05-01): create comprehensive test page with all markdown elements

### Task 2: Add Theme Switching to Test Page

**Goal:** Enable testing both light and dark themes without browser dev tools.

**Implementation:**
1. Add CSS variables for both themes
2. Create theme toggle buttons
3. Apply theme classes to container
4. Ensure all elements respond to theme change

**Files to modify:**
- Modify: test.html

**Commit:** feat(05-01): add theme switching to test page

### Task 3: Verify All Elements Render Correctly

**Goal:** Confirm every markdown element displays with proper Claude styling.

**Implementation:**
1. Open test.html in Chrome
2. Verify each element type renders correctly
3. Check spacing, typography, colors
4. Document any visual issues
5. Fix any CSS issues found

**Files to modify:**
- Modify: content/claude-markdown.css (if fixes needed)

**Commit:** fix(05-01): correct styling issues found during test page verification

## Success Criteria

- [ ] test.html opens without errors in Chrome
- [ ] All markdown element types are represented
- [ ] Light and dark themes both render correctly
- [ ] Visual indicators display properly
- [ ] Page serves as comprehensive styling reference

## Dependencies

None - builds on existing CSS from Phase 1.

## Notes

- Test page should work without the extension installed (standalone CSS)
- Include sample content that looks realistic
- Add comments indicating which CSS rules each section exercises
