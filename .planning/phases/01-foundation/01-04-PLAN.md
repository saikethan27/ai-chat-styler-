# Plan 01-04: Create Test Page

## Objective
Create test.html with comprehensive markdown elements to validate that Claude styling is applied correctly.

## Context
The test page serves as a static validation tool before testing on real AI chat sites. It must include all markdown elements that the extension will style:
- Headings (h1-h6)
- Paragraphs with bold and italic text
- Inline code
- Code blocks (with and without language specification)
- Unordered lists (with nesting)
- Ordered lists (with nesting)
- Blockquotes (single and nested)
- Tables (with headers and multiple rows)
- Links
- Horizontal rules
- Combined elements (markdown inside blockquotes, lists with code, etc.)

The test page should:
- Be a standalone HTML file
- Include claude_index.css for CSS variables
- Include claude-markdown.css for styling
- Have a toggle button to switch between light and dark mode
- Display all elements both unstyled (reference) and styled (with .claude-styled class)

## Dependencies
- Plan 01-02 (claude-markdown.css) should be complete so the test page can reference it

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create test.html structure
**Type:** implementation
**File:** test.html

Create HTML file with:

1. **HTML boilerplate**
   - DOCTYPE, html, head, body
   - Meta charset UTF-8
   - Title: "Claude UI/UX Extension - Test Page"

2. **CSS includes**
   - Link to claude_index.css (for CSS variables)
   - Link to content/claude-markdown.css (for scoped styling)
   - Inline styles for the test page layout (not the markdown content)

3. **Test page layout**
   - Header with title and description
   - Dark mode toggle button
   - Two columns or sections:
     - "Unstyled" - raw markdown elements
     - "Claude Styled" - same elements wrapped in .claude-styled div

4. **Dark mode toggle**
   - Button that toggles .dark class on body or containers
   - Updates CSS variables automatically via claude_index.css

### Task 2: Add all markdown elements
**Type:** implementation
**File:** test.html

Include comprehensive markdown examples in both unstyled and styled sections:

1. **Headings**
   - h1: "Heading 1"
   - h2: "Heading 2"
   - h3: "Heading 3"
   - h4: "Heading 4"
   - h5: "Heading 5"
   - h6: "Heading 6"

2. **Paragraphs and text formatting**
   - Regular paragraph with multiple sentences
   - Paragraph with **bold text** (strong)
   - Paragraph with *italic text* (em)
   - Paragraph with ***bold and italic***
   - Paragraph with `inline code`

3. **Code blocks**
   - Code block without language:
     ```
     plain code block
     ```
   - Code block with JavaScript:
     ```javascript
     function hello() {
       console.log("Hello, world!");
     }
     ```
   - Code block with Python:
     ```python
     def hello():
         print("Hello, world!")
     ```

4. **Lists**
   - Unordered list with items
   - Nested unordered list
   - Ordered list with items
   - Nested ordered list
   - Mixed nested lists (ul inside ol, ol inside ul)

5. **Blockquotes**
   - Simple blockquote
   - Blockquote with multiple paragraphs
   - Nested blockquote
   - Blockquote containing other elements (lists, code)

6. **Tables**
   - Simple table with header and data rows
   - Table with alignment (left, center, right)
   - Table with code and links inside cells

7. **Links**
   - Inline link: [Link text](https://example.com)
   - Link with title: [Link](https://example.com "Title")

8. **Horizontal rules**
   - hr element between sections

9. **Complex combinations**
   - List item with inline code and bold text
   - Blockquote with a list inside
   - Table cell with formatted text

### Task 3: Add interactive controls
**Type:** implementation
**File:** test.html

Add JavaScript for:
- Dark mode toggle button
- Console logging for debugging
- Optional: button to manually toggle .claude-styled class on/off

### Task 4: Verify test page completeness
**Type:** verification

Validate:
- [ ] All markdown elements from requirements are present
- [ ] Both unstyled and styled versions exist for comparison
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works correctly
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] CSS files are correctly linked
- [ ] Page is valid HTML5

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] test.html exists and is valid HTML5
- [ ] All markdown elements are present (h1-h6, p, strong, em, code, pre, ul, ol, li, blockquote, table, a, hr)
- [ ] Both unstyled and styled (.claude-styled) versions are visible
- [ ] Dark mode toggle switches CSS variables correctly
- [ ] Page displays correctly in Chrome
- [ ] All elements render with Claude styling when in .claude-styled container

## must_haves (for goal-backward verification)

1. Test page contains all markdown elements specified in requirements (headings, bold, inline code, code blocks, lists, blockquotes, tables, links, horizontal rules)
2. Page includes both unstyled reference and styled versions for comparison
3. Dark mode toggle allows testing both light and dark themes
4. CSS variables from claude_index.css are properly applied
5. Scoped .claude-styled class applies correct styling to all elements
6. Page serves as a validation tool for Phase 1 success criteria
