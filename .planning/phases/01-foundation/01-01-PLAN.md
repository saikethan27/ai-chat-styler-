# Plan 01-01: Create Extension Manifest

## Objective
Create manifest.json with Chrome Extension Manifest V3 format including permissions for activeTab, scripting, and storage.

## Context
- Extension name: "Claude UI/UX for AI Chats"
- Version: 1.0.0
- Description: "Apply Claude's beautiful markdown styling to AI chat platforms"
- Needs content script for all URLs
- Needs popup for user controls
- Needs background service worker
- Icons required for Chrome Web Store and browser toolbar

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create manifest.json
**Type:** implementation
**File:** manifest.json

Create Manifest V3 with:
- manifest_version: 3
- name: "Claude UI/UX for AI Chats"
- version: "1.0.0"
- description: "Apply Claude's beautiful markdown styling to AI chat platforms"
- permissions: ["activeTab", "scripting", "storage"]
- host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]
- content_scripts entry for content/inject.js with matches: ["<all_urls>"]
- action (popup) entry for popup/popup.html with default icon references
- background service_worker entry for background.js
- web_accessible_resources for CSS files (claude_index.css, claude-markdown.css)
- icons entry mapping 16, 48, 128 to icons/icon{size}.png

### Task 2: Create icon placeholders
**Type:** implementation
**Files:**
  - icons/icon16.png
  - icons/icon48.png
  - icons/icon128.png

Create or copy placeholder icon files. These can be simple colored squares or the Claude logo in appropriate sizes. The icons folder must exist at the extension root.

### Task 3: Verify manifest structure
**Type:** verification

Validate:
- [ ] JSON is valid (use JSON.parse or online validator)
- [ ] All required fields present (manifest_version, name, version)
- [ ] Permissions are correct for the use case (activeTab, scripting, storage)
- [ ] Host permissions include <all_urls> for universal markdown styling
- [ ] Content script configuration points to correct file path
- [ ] web_accessible_resources exposes CSS files for injection

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] manifest.json exists at extension root and is valid JSON
- [ ] Chrome can load the extension without errors (no red errors in chrome://extensions)
- [ ] All required permissions (activeTab, scripting, storage) are declared
- [ ] Content script, popup, and background entries are configured
- [ ] Icons exist in icons/ folder
- [ ] Extension appears in Chrome toolbar with icon

## must_haves (for goal-backward verification)

1. Extension manifest loads in Chrome without errors
2. All required permissions (activeTab, scripting, storage) are declared
3. Content script, popup, and background entries are configured
4. web_accessible_resources allows CSS injection into pages
5. Icons display correctly in Chrome toolbar
